Hacks to handle flow separation:

	consider computing pressure forces with a min pressure coefficient around
-1.  This will reduce the lift and increase the drag on airfoils which have
a very strong leading edge velocity gradient.
	DOESN'T WORK GREAT.  Tends to cap lift instead of having it fall off
	also limits drag.
